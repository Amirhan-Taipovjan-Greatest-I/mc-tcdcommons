TCDCommons is my personal Minecraft modding library. It aims to help optimize as well as speed up the development of my mods. It also helps avoid re-writing the same code for every mod. Because this mod is a library, it does not offer any useful front-end features to the user (as of right now). As such, I plan on using this mod as an embedded library, so as to not end up inconveniencing people, while at the same time making modding easier. As of v1.0, this mod offers GUI, config, as well as a few other miscellaneous utilities.
